/**
 * Fee Adjustment Rule
 *
 * Precedence semantics
 * -------------------
 * Rules are evaluated in ascending `priority` order — a **lower number means
 * higher priority** (priority 1 runs before priority 10).  When two rules share
 * the same priority value they are further sorted by `name` (ascending) so
 * the evaluation order is always fully deterministic.
 *
 * Conflict resolution policies
 * ----------------------------
 * When multiple rules match the same student/payment context the
 * `conflictResolutionPolicy` field controls how the engine handles them:
 *
 *   "stack"      (default) — all matching rules are applied in priority order,
 *                each one operating on the fee already modified by prior rules.
 *
 *   "first_only" — only the single highest-priority matching rule is applied;
 *                all subsequent matches are ignored.
 *
 *   "best_for_student" — among all matching discount rules the one that
 *                reduces the fee the most is selected; penalty rules are
 *                always stacked on top regardless.
 *
 * The policy stored on a rule acts as a *suggestion* for that rule's conflict
 * group.  When rules in the same priority band disagree the engine falls back
 * to "stack" to remain safe and predictable.
